# Google Threat Intelligence Tools

This project serves as a repository of scripts, examples, and more to help customers interact with Google Threat Intelligence via API.

## API Client
A comprehensive, interactive command-line tool for interacting with various endpoints of the Google Threat Intelligence API. This script provides a user-friendly menu to access a wide range of threat intelligence data, from IoC reports to advanced corpus searches, without needing to write code for each request.

## Feed Downloader
This Python script provides a command-line interface to download per-minute feed batches and artifacts from Google Threat Intelligence IOC Feeds. It allows users to retrieve data for various threat types, including files, domains, IP addresses, and URLs, and to download specific artifacts like PCAP, memory dumps, and event logs (EVTX) from sandbox analyses.
